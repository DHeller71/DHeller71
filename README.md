# Welcome to my page!

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Heller (@DHeller71)
- Iâ€™m interested in sports, data, and economics. I love games and sports, ex-college football player so always down to chop it up about the game. 
- I'm passionate about learning where equity can truly be found. The economic triple point of free markets, fair trade and universal stability.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning data analytics and machine learning. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning models and contests that will help me understand more about best practices when creating pipelines and models.
