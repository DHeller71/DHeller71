# Welcome to my Git page!

- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Daniel Heller (@DHeller71)
- Iâ€™m interested in sports, data, and economics. I love games and sports, I am an ex-college offensive lineman so always down to chop it up about the game. Gaming is my competitive outlet now. 
- I'm passionate about learning the trends in human nature, why is it we are such creatures of habit? Everything is quantifiable and with that we can find the trends and habits of society. Through machine learning and data I want to find how we can better stabilize our economy, uplift the lower ends of society and create an increase in the quality of life for every individual.
- I'm also intrigued by economics and currencies. The balance between the spending of fiscal policies, hoping to create equity and allow more inclusion between social classes, and the income creation of monetary policy; with their upholding and control, or lack there of, of how money is released and the structuring of free markets. Economically my where equity can truly be found. The economic triple point of free markets, fair trade and universal stability.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning **data analytics** and **machine learning**. 
- Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on machine learning models and contests that will help me understand more about best practices when creating pipelines and classifications.
